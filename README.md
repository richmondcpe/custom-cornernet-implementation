# Custom CornerNet Implementation

A fully customized and simplified CornerNet-style object detection model built using PyTorch.  
This project includes:

- A recursive Hourglass backbone  
- Corner heatmap, offset, and embedding heads  
- COCO-style dataset loader  
- Custom training loop and loss functions  
- Full testing + visualization pipeline  
- Google Colab–friendly environment  

Designed for academic use, portfolio presentation, and experimentation with corner-based object detection systems.
